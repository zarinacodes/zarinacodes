### Hey there 👋

I’m a frontend developer working mostly with React and TypeScript.

Most of my work happens in private repositories.  
What you’ll find here are small experiments and side projects. I build these things to better understand UI decisions, frontend trade-offs, and how small choices affect the final product.

I care about writing code that’s easy to read, easy to change, and easy to work with. For myself and for others 🙂
